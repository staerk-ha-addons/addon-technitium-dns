## 🌐 Modern DNS Solution for Home Assistant

A fully featured DNS server for Home Assistant that acts as a secure forwarding DNS server, querying external providers using modern encrypted protocols. Perfect for improving your home network's privacy and security.

## ✨ Features

A fully featured DNS server for Home Assistant that:

- 🔒 Securely forwards DNS queries using DoH/DoT/DoQ
- 🌐 Supports local DNS zones and custom domains
- ⚡ Provides fast DNS caching
- 🛡️ Includes DNS filtering and blocking

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This add-on uses **host networking** mode to properly function as a DNS server. This means it binds directly to the host's network interfaces rather than using Docker's network isolation. Port 53 (DNS) must be available on your host system.

## DNS Flow and Protocol Options

> This diagram illustrates how DNS queries flow through your network, showing both unencrypted (🔓) and encrypted (🔐) paths. Local devices can use either standard DNS or secure protocols (DoH/DoT/DoQ) to query the Technitium DNS Server, which then forwards requests to Cloudflare using selected dns_forwarders.
